# Music Recommendation System

This project implements a music recommendation system using K-Means clustering, designed to suggest similar songs based on various audio features. The system begins by loading a dataset containing song attributes such as popularity, danceability, energy, loudness, and tempo, among others. The data is then standardized using `StandardScaler` to ensure consistency in scaling, as the K-Means algorithm is sensitive to feature magnitudes. Songs are grouped into clusters based on these features, with the assumption that songs in the same cluster share similar characteristics. Once the songs are clustered, the recommendation function allows the user to input a song, and it returns a list of other songs from the same cluster, sorted by tempo, which are likely to have a similar vibe. The system guarantees that the song provided by the user will always be included in the recommended list. This project is useful for applications where song similarity based on attributes is needed, and it can be extended to work with larger datasets or more advanced recommendation techniques. The code requires Python and the Pandas and Scikit-Learn libraries for data manipulation and clustering.
